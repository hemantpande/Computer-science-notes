# Backend developer study plan

Please refer the below suggested study plan for ramping up in full-stack development for .NET track.

## Abstract concepts

### Clean code
- Reading the clean code book is highly recommended and adds a lot to the wisdom of the developer. [Online version](https://enos.itcollege.ee/~jpoial/oop/naited/Clean%20Code.pdf). There are ample repositories on github, such as [this one](https://github.com/thangchung/clean-code-dotnet) which can give a summary of this topic.
- (Advanced) Additional books are **The Pragmatic Programmer**. Must read.

### Test driven development
- Code without corresponding tests is not production ready code. Good codebases maintain a high level of code coverage. Designing good tests is a skill. Focus should be on adding tests that are of value, rather then just chasing the coverage numbers, but that pragmatism requires a lot of wisdom.
- This is a [good resource](http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/lets-play-tdd) to start understanding how to do test-driven development.

### Design patterns
- [Head first design patterns](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Head_First_Design_Patterns/Kw8LEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) is a very good book to learn patterns in a fun way. You can refer the older edition of this book too.
- One of the best [resource](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans) on github.
- Plenty of courses on Pluralsight as well, such as [this one](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/patterns-library) and [this one](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/design-patterns-in-c) in C#.net

### HTTP basics
- [This course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/https-every-developer-must-know) is good enough
- For reference, [Mozilla developer network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)

### REST
- Learning to build good rest API's is a fundamental skill for a backend developer. These [set of guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines) from Microsoft are really good source on how to design them.
- [Good course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/rest-fundamental) on Pluralsight on fundamental concepts.
- [Course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/asp-dot-net-core-restful-api-building) on developing REST api's in ASP.NET.

### Microservices
- [CAP theorem](https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices)
- [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io) is a very rich resource to learn microsevice based architecture with a lot of practical examples, should be taken with a pinch of salt.
- [Pluralsight path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/net-microservices) on microservices.
- [Exhaustive list](https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices) of all resources 

## .NET specific learning

### C#
- Follow [this path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/csharp) on C# on pluralsight.
- LINQ is an extremely important tool to learn when writing C# code. [Best resource on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) and a very [good course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/linq-more-effective)

## Docker and Kubernetes
- [Good course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/docker-kubernetes-dot-net-developers-fundamentals) for .NET developers.
- [Katacode](https://www.katacoda.com) is an awesome resource to learn many tools right in the browser. They have good collection of hands on labs for docker and k8s, all for free.

## Cloud and Azure
- Follow Azure certifications from Microsoft.
